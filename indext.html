      <li class="info"><strong>1971</strong> - 
      Born on 28th June 1971 in South Africa. Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a South African-born, Canadian-American business magnate, engineer, inventor and investor. He is the CEO and CTO of SpaceX, CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors, and chairman of SolarCity. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company focused on tunnels specialized for electric vehicles. 
       <li class="info"><strong>1999</strong> - 
       With US$28,000 money borrowed from Musk's father, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri started online software startup Zip2 in 1995. They set up shop in Palo Alto in a small rented office. For the newspaper publishing sector, the company created and sold an Internet city guide including maps, directions, and yellow pages. Musk claims that he couldn't afford an apartment before the company became popular, so he rented an office, slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.
        <li class="info"><strong>2000</strong> -
        Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2. The company was one of the first federally insured internet banks, with over 200,000 customers in its first months of existence. Musk's investors viewed him as inexperienced, and before the end of the year, he had been replaced by Bill Harris, the CEO of Intuit. To minimize competition, X.com merged with online bank Confinity the following year. Confinity, which was founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's. 
         <li class="info"><strong>2002</strong> - 
         With US$100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies
          <li class="info"><strong>2004</strong> -
